# iotproject
The aim of the project is to provide access control by opening and closing a lock remotely  using the fingerprint of the user as the key .The user operates a mobile app which will prompt  him for providing his fingerprint. The fingerprint validation is done in the mobile app itself and  the validation status – verified or failed is updated in a cloud database. This validation status is  read by the GISMO-V board with a ESP32 microcontroller. If the validation is successful the  ESP32 will operate a relay which will in turn open a electromagnetic door lock to open the  door. The ESP32 controller is a 32-bit dual core processor with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth  capabilities built on-chip. The Wi-Fi capability is used to join a Wi-Fi network and connect to  the Internet. The validation status is pushed to a cloud database – Google’s Firebase which is  created for the project. The database credentials – the host URL and the database authentication  key are to be fed into the firmware. The Firebase database is a key-value based database and  using the Firebase credentials the fingerprint validation status is accessed by the ESP microcontroller
